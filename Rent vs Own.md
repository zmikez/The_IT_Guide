# Rent vs Own
* Previously Buy vs Build. With current license models in the marketplace today, BvB has morphed to RvO. Many things that we build today, we do not own (SAP or Salesforce code). We can build all we want but we have to pay the platform owner to run it. 
  * We MAY own the code but we have to pay to use (run) it.
* How do I know if I own it?:
  * If I do not have the freedom to run the code when and where I want to run it, then I do not own it.
  * If I have to keep paying to run it, then I do not own it.
* What MUST I Own:
  * If it is part of what differentiates you in the market place.
  * If it is your IP (intellectual Property).
  * If it is what makes you money.

* What CAN I Rent:
  * Everything else.
* What MUST I Rent:
  * If it is part of industry / governmental regulation.
