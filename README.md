# The_IT_Guide
This is a general guideline for myself on all concepts for IT, life, and everything. Use it for your own life if you wish but the ideas are mine. They have been learned the hard way and harshly analyzed over years. Disagree if you wish, you are allowed to be wrong.

These are all generalizations but generalizations based on the observation of and the simplification of facts. Sure, there are exceptions but for every 100 people that think that they are an exception of the rule, 99 are wrong and that 1 that is correct is probably wrong too.


## Leave Your Feelings at the Door
This is a harsh look at various topics. If you are easily offended; You are not ready.
Direct, downright rude, and some time humorous words are used to drive home topics and concepts. Most of the topics in this guide were learned in a harsh, unforgiving manner and I don't think that documenting them in any other way would do them justice.

A famous fictional person once said:
>There is no crying in baseball.
