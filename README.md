# The_IT_Guide
This is a general guideline for myself on all concepts for IT, life, and everything. Use it for your own life if you wish but the ideas are mine. They have been learned the hard way and harshly analyzed over years. Disagree if you wish, you are allowed to be wrong.

# Leave Your Feelings at the Door
This is a harsh look at various topics. If you are easily offended, then leave and come back after you grow up; You are not ready.
Direct and downright rude words are used to drive home topics and concepts. Most of the topics in this guide were learned in a harsh, unforgiving manner and I don't think that documenting them in any other way would do them justice.
There is no crying in IT.
