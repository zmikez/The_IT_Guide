# The_IT_Guide
This is a general guideline for myself on all concepts for Information Technology (IT), life, and everything. Use it for your own career and/or life if you wish but the ideas and concepts are mine. They have been learned the hard way and harshly analyzed over years. Disagree if you wish, you are allowed to be wrong.

__VERY IMPORTANT__

👉🏻These are all generalizations but generalizations based on the observation of and the simplification of facts. Sure, there are exceptions but for every 100 people that think that they are an exception of the rule, 99 are wrong and that 1 that is correct is probably wrong too.👈🏻

👆🏻Come back and read this OFTEN.👆🏻



## Leave Your Feelings at the Door
This is a harsh look at various topics. If you are easily offended; You are not ready.
Direct, downright rude, and some time humorous words and phrases are used to drive home topics and concepts. Most of the topics in this guide were learned in a harsh, unforgiving manner and I don't think that documenting them in any other way would do them justice.

This is written for me but I'm letting you have a peek at the truths of the universe.
There may also be a bit of hyperbole here and there but in truth, not really.

A famous fictional person once said:
>There is no crying in baseball.
