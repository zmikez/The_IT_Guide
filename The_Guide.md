# Policies

These are all generalizations but generalizations based on the observation of, and the simplification of, facts. Sure, there are exceptions, but for every 100 people that think that they are an exception of the rule, 99 are wrong and that 1 that is correct is probably wrong too.

## Nuance

-   Nuance (exceptions) should be removed. When we remove nuance, we need to be aware that we also remove:

    -   Complexity.

    -   Logic decision points.

    -   Opportunities to legitimize fraud.

    -   Opportunities to exercise compassion.

        -   This needs more thought on how can one prevent nuance and still exercise compassion.

 

## Rent vs Own

-   Previously Buy vs Build. With current license models in the marketplace today, BvB has morphed to RvO. Many things that we build today, we do not own (SAP code, Salesforce code, etc.). We can build all we want but we have to pay the platform owner to run it.

    -   We MAY own the code but we have to pay to use (run) it.

-   How do I know if I own it?:

    -   If I do not have the freedom to run the code when and where I want to run it, then I **DO NOT** own it.

        -   To clarify, If I cannot move to from its current location to a different cloud or to on-prem, then I **DO NOT** own it.

    -   If I have to keep paying to run it, then I **DO NOT** own it.

        -   This applies to **EVERYTHING** in life.

            -   If you stop paying the loan on your car, the bank takes it. You **DO NOT** own it.

            -   If you stop pay the property taxes on your house, the government takes it. You **DO NOT** own it.

-   What MUST I own:

    -   If it is part of what differentiates you in the market place.

    -   If it is your Intellectual Property.

    -   If it is what makes you money.

        -   (Loo at what Facebook did to publications.)

-   What MUST I rent:

    -   If it is part of governmental regulation.

    -   If it is part of industry regulation.

    -   If it requires unique or unusual knowledge. (security / spam)

    -   If it changes a lot. (security / spam)

-   What CAN I rent:

    -   Everything else.

-   What CAN I own:

    -   Nothing else.

-   Examples:

    -   Rented:

        -   SAP/ABAP

        -   Salesforce

        -   Parts of Azure that are not transportable to other platforms.

    -   Owned

        -   SI

        -   .Net

        -   PHP

        -   JAVA (Maybe leaning toward probably. The license from Oracle requires more investigation)

 

## Skill Sets

-   Every time you introduce a new skill set, you:

    -   Divide your workforce.

        -   This **CAN** cause architecture / design to follow which team has free capacity. Architecture / design should NEVER be dictated by who is available to do the work.

        -   This **WILL** cause resource issues.

        -   This **WILL** reduce growth opportunities within the company and this in turn **WILL** cause you to lose people.

        -   This **WILL** complicate your org chart.

        -   This **WILL** complicate project management.

    -   Create a tribal (Us v Them) mindset **WITHIN** your company. **<- This shoud scare the crap out of you! If not, quit and leave; you've already lost.**

        -   This **WILL** create tension with-in the company.

        -   The **WILL** reduce inter-company cooperation.

        -   This **CAN** (and most likely **WILL**) cause infighting with-in your company.

        -   This **WILL** create divided loyalties with-in your company.

        -   This **IS** a **VERY** dumb thing to do.

-   The reverse is also true. Every time that you reduce skill sets, you:

    -   Combine divisions with-in your workforce.

    -   Create a more unified mindset.

    -   Increase opportunities for mentorship.

    -   Increase opportunities for professional growth.
    -   Create opportunities to unify your workforce into a team.

## Teamwork

-   Teamwork **can** increase the productivity of the individual.

-   There is a point at which the increase in teamwork **decreases** the productivity of ALL individuals in the team. Team size and function should be designed and regualted with purpose.

-   'Militant' cries and demand for teamwork must be looked at with suspicion.
    -   Cries for team work typically hide incompatency.

    -   The louder the cry for teamwork, the less capable that person is.

-   **This still needs a lot of work to clean this up and sharpen it.**

 

## Broad Think vs Deep Think

-   This still needs some 'deep think".

 

## Focused Spending

-   Focus your spending on as few of your vendors / suppliers as possible.

    -   2 max

    -   3 if you are not really serious and just want to pretend.

-   Identify which of your vendors are key and ONLY use those vendors.

-   The vast majority of technology is commodity now.

    -   CRM: CRM is a commodity. Any / All of the major players have a completely passible / usable CRM system that will do what you need to do. Buy one that is from one of your 2 key vendors.

    -   ERP: ERP 'can' get very specialized but unless you are in a VERY vertical market, any will do just keep your head on straight when implementing.

    -   WHM:

        -   Just like with CRM, WRM are a commodity use one from one of your two vendors.

        -   More than likely, you don't even need to do your own warehousing unless you do something that is unique and then you should be worried. Warehousing in general falls into the Rent vs Own category. See above.
